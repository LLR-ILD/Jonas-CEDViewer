#######################################################

pyced has been developed during the DESYn summerstudent 
programme 2013 by Bjoern Klaas. See the report:
pyced_overview.pdf as a quick introduction.


Requirements:
---------------
 
ilcsoft needs to be installed with a Root version that has python 
enabled and the lcio Root dictionary has to be built.
For example use 

 /afs/desy.de/project/ilcsoft/sw/x86_64_gcc44_sl6/v01-17-03/

for SL6 and compatible machines.

Run pyced:

Initialize the environment:
-----------------------------


# need to extend the python path and the dynamic search path
export PYTHONPATH=${LCIO}/src/python:${ROOTSYS}/lib

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CEDLIB:$MULIB
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CEDLIB:$MULIB

where $CEDLIB and $MULIB are the library pathes for the current 
CED and MarlinUtil versions.

You can use the env.sh script:

source env.sh  /afs/desy.de/project/ilcsoft/sw/x86_64_gcc44_sl6/v01-17-03/init_ilcsoft.sh

for this.


Run pyced:
---------

python -i pyced.py /data/ilcsoft/data/rv01-16-p05_500.sv01-14-01-p00.mILD_o1_v05.E500-TDR_ws.I37623.P6f_bbcyyc.eR.pL-00025-REC.slcio


Configuration:
-------------

Edit pyced.cfg.py as needed. Currently only ReconstructedParticles and MCParticles are drawn.
Change draw attribute for a givne type to True, to also draw objects of this type.


Users can pre-define functions and set cuts in pyced_user.py.
